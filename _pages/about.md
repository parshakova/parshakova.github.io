I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://icme.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Computational Mathematics</a> at Stanford and I am lucky to be advised by <a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/" target="_blank">Prof. Stephen Boyd</a>. 


My primary research objective is to develop efficient algorithms for computational problems using techniques from optimization, discrete mathematics and statistics, to analyze and to bring theoretical guarantees about these methods.


I received Bachelor's in the <a
href="http://id.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?document_srl=21142&mid=rnews"
target="_blank">Department of Industrial Design</a> and Master's at the <a
href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/?language=en" target="_blank">School of Electrical
Engineering</a> at KAIST.
