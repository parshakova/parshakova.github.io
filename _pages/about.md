I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://icme.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Computational Mathematics</a> at Stanford, working with Prof. <a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/" target="_blank">Stephen Boyd</a>. 


My primary research objective is to develop efficient algorithms for computational problems using techniques from optimization, discrete mathematics and statistics.
In particular, my research interests include
* large-scale and distributed convex optimization,
* network science, learning and inference for network data,
* numerical and randomized linear algebra,
* low rank and structured optimization,
* machine learning.


Prior to my Ph.D., I received Bachelor's in <a
href="http://id.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?document_srl=21142&mid=rnews"
target="_blank">Industrial Design</a> and Master's in <a
href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Electrical
Engineering</a> at KAIST.
