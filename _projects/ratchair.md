Displacements of large objects induced by vibration are
a common occurrence, but the motion is generally
unpredictable. Think for instance of an unbalanced
front-loading washing machine. For controlled
movement, wheels or legs are usually preferred.
<br><br>
In this work, we explore a strategy for moving
everyday objects by introducing or harvesting random
external vibration rather than using a mechanical
system with wheels. We designed vibration modules
that can be easily attached to furniture and objects.
After learning how several random bursts of vibration
affect its pose, an optimization algorithm discovers the
optimal sequence of vibration patterns required to
(slowly but surely) move the object to a specified
position.
