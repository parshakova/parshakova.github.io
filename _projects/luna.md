Each pixel of 8x8 dot matrix lives by rules of Conway’s game of life, so-called cellular automaton.
In Conway’s model, different patterns are like species, they are developed in response to evolution.
Therefore Luna simulates the biological system. So it is real universes with organisms that have own
evolution. The device is called Luna, because this universe is going to be with a wearer just as Moon with
Earth, reminding a user that s/he is not alone having alive satellite nearby.
<br><br>
Luna is a world of living organisms. To provoke Big Bang user needs to shake sphere and a new
world will be born in a random manner. Big Bang is accompanied by explosion animation. The device has a tilt
ball switch for recognizing shakes.
<br><br>
A creator can also exhale her spirit into Luna to make the self-sustaining universe. In this case, blowing
is recognized my a microphone amplifier and one pattern among previously prepared never-dying
patterns will be displayed. Breathing is accompanied by an animation of expanding circles.
Luna is a form of everyday jewelry with an unlimited amount of species and lives.
