### UMorph: self-change tracker to reflect yourself to the future and past
<br />

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/umorph2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/umorph3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

Taking photos has become not only a daily but also an
automatic activity. But how do we use all these
pictures? Storage and retrieval are certainly not as well
developed as capturing. Storage systems organize
photos in the temporal dimension, for example, the
Facebook service “Year in Review” or in visual diaries,
but typically do not support a systematic comparison.
<br><br>
That was the inspiration for this demonstration,
employing automatically taken photographs and
arranging them so that one could easily go back in time
to reflect oneself to the future and past. This is useful
for tracking well-being and body changes using time
physicalization with a natural interface, as well as an
unobtrusive way for systematic capturing of facial
images over time.
