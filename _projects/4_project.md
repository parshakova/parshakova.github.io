The device is called  “Eyeball”,  it is an extension of your natural eye,  since literally, it replaces your eyes with itself.
<br><br>
The idea is in letting yourself explore secret places which cannot be  entered with an entire body.  An additional feature of the Eyeball is that it moves by rolling, such that a world it streams is rolling as well, which gives rich disorienting and mismatching effect. Hence, in order to understand streamed data user has to compensate a mismatching information by thinking and by other senses.  This is a nice exercise for your brains.
<br><br>
In the game “Perception”, a user has to observe a hidden place and find a secret message.  In our game, this message is “Hate is love” because of a word  “hate” that is written on the wall, and which turns into “love” in reflection. This is exactly what happens when you look at things under new angles or their reflections.  The purpose of the game is to make a person realize that if s/he changes the way to look at things,  the things s/he looks at will change.
<br><br>
“Roll  the  Eyeball”  is composed of several  parts:  Eyeball,  device  to  control  a locomotion  of  ball  placed in  one  of  user’s  hands  (smartphone  with  Android  app  running  on  it),  device  which  shows  streamed  video  fixed  in  front  of  one  of the user’s  eyes  like  a  pirate  band  (smartphone  with  Android  app  running  on  it  behind  biconvex  lens),  and  a secret  place  itself (1m x 0.8m x 1.5m  box).
